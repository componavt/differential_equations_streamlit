# Differential Equations Streamlit App

This Streamlit web application visualizes solutions to a gene regulatory system of differential equations. The numerical solutions are precomputed and stored in a `.pkl` file and loaded by the app.

## üåê Purpose

The app is designed for researchers to explore the behavior of gene regulatory dynamics under varying parameters such as:

- **Œ± (alpha)**: sensitivity parameter
- **Œ≥‚ÇÅ, Œ≥‚ÇÇ (gamma1, gamma2)**: degradation or feedback coefficients
- **Initial conditions**: variations near equilibrium
- **Solver methods**: RK45, Radau, DOP853, Symplectic, etc.

# Gene Regulatory ODE System ‚Äì Streamlit App  

Explore numerical solutions to a system of ODEs modeling gene regulation using different solvers and parameter settings.
